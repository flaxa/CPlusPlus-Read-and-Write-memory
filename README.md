# c++ dummyProgram Project
Simple dummy program with reader and writer.

Written in c++ using the windows API these are my first c++ programs.

The dummy program is executed first it displays the PID, a int, a string, a char array, pointer to the int, pointer to the pointer, and a pointer to this pointer. It also displays the location in memory of all these variables.

The reader can then be executed where it will ask for the PID and the base address of the program, it will then display some of the data from the dummy program.

The writer can be used to change data stored in the variables you can then press enter on the dummy program to see that changes take effect.
